However, the first caption provides more specific information about the wind blowing hard and the engine humming, which could be useful for someone trying to identify the source of the sound or for someone trying to understand the context in which the sound was recorded. The second caption is more general and could be useful for someone trying to identify the sound in a larger context, such as a natural soundscape or a cityscape. Therefore, both captions are equally valid and useful for different purposes."
